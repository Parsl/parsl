# E126: continuation line over-indented for hanging indent
# This one is bad. Sometimes ordering matters, conditional imports
# setting env vars necessary etc.
# E402: module level import not at top of file
# E129: Visual indent to not match indent as next line, counter eg here:
# https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/386
# W504: line break after binary operator
#       (Raised by flake8 even when it is followed)
