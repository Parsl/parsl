headline: Productive parallel programming in Python
description: |
  Parsl is a flexible and scalable parallel programming library for Python.
  Parsl augments Python with simple constructs for encoding parallelism. 
  Developers annotate Python functions to specify opportunities for 
  concurrent execution. These annotated functions, called apps, may represent 
  pure Python functions or calls to external applications. Parsl further 
  allows invocations of these apps, called tasks, to be connected by shared 
  input/output data (e.g., Python objects or files) via which Parsl 
  constructs a dynamic dependency graph of tasks to manage concurrent task 
  execution where possible.
