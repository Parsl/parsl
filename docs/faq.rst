How can I debug a Parsl script?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Parsl interfaces with the Python logger. To enable logging of Parsl's
progress to stdout, turn on the logger as follows. Alternatively, you
can configure the file logger to write to an output file.

.. code-block:: python

   import parsl

   # Emit log lines to the screen
   parsl.set_stream_logger()

   # Write log to file, specify level of detail for logs
   parsl.set_file_logger(FILENAME, level=logging.DEBUG)

.. note::
   Parsl's logging will not capture STDOUT/STDERR from the apps themselves.
   Follow instructions below for application logs.


How can I view outputs and errors from apps?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Parsl apps include keyword arguments for capturing stderr and stdout in files.

.. code-block:: python

   @bash_app
   def hello(msg, stdout=None):
       return 'echo {}'.format(msg)

   # When hello() runs the STDOUT will be written to 'hello.txt'
   hello('Hello world', stdout='hello.txt')

How can I make an App dependent on multiple inputs?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can pass any number of futures in to a single App either as positional arguments
or as a list of futures via the special keyword ``inputs=[]``.
The App will wait for all inputs to be satisfied before execution.


Can I pass any Python object between apps?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

No. Unfortunately, only `picklable <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#what-can-be-pickled-and-unpickled>`_ objects can be passed between apps.
For objects that can't be pickled, it is recommended to use object specific methods
to write the object into a file and use files to communicate between apps.

How do I specify where apps should be run?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Parsl's multi-executor support allows you to define the executor (including local threads)
on which an App should be executed. For example:

.. code-block:: python

     @python_app(executors=['SuperComputer1'])
     def BigSimulation(...):
         ...

     @python_app(executors=['GPUMachine'])
     def Visualize (...)
         ...

Workers do not connect back to Parsl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are running via ssh to a remote system from your local machine, or from the
login node of a cluster/supercomputer, it is necessary to have a public IP to which
the workers can connect back. While our remote execution systems can identify the
IP address automatically in certain cases, it is safer to specify the address explicitly.
Parsl provides a few heuristic based address resolution methods that could be useful,
however with complex networks some trial and error might be necessary to find the
right address or network interface to use.



For `parsl.executors.HighThroughputExecutor` the address is specified in the :class:`~parsl.config.Config`
as shown below :

.. code-block:: python

    # THIS IS A CONFIG FRAGMENT FOR ILLUSTRATION
    from parsl.config import Config
    from parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor
    from parsl.addresses import address_by_route, address_by_query, address_by_hostname
    config = Config(
        executors=[
            HighThroughputExecutor(
                label='ALCF_theta_local',
                address='<AA.BB.CC.DD>'          # specify public ip here
                # address=address_by_route()     # Alternatively you can try this
                # address=address_by_query()     # Alternatively you can try this
                # address=address_by_hostname()  # Alternatively you can try this
            )
        ],
    )


.. note::
   Another possibility that can cause workers not to connect back to Parsl is an incompatibility between
   the system and the pre-compiled bindings used for pyzmq. As a last resort, you can try:
   ``pip install --upgrade --no-binary pyzmq pyzmq``, which forces re-compilation.

For the `parsl.executors.HighThroughputExecutor` as well as the `parsl.executors.ExtremeScaleExecutor`, ``address`` is a keyword argument
taken at initialization. Here is an example for the `parsl.executors.HighThroughputExecutor`:

.. code-block:: python

    # THIS IS A CONFIG FRAGMENT FOR ILLUSTRATION
    from parsl.config import Config
    from parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor
    from parsl.addresses import address_by_route, address_by_query, address_by_hostname

    config = Config(
        executors=[
            HighThroughputExecutor(
                label='NERSC_Cori',
                address='<AA.BB.CC.DD>'          # specify public ip here
                # address=address_by_route()     # Alternatively you can try this
                # address=address_by_query()     # Alternatively you can try this
                # address=address_by_hostname()  # Alternatively you can try this
            )
        ],
    )


.. note::
   On certain systems such as the Midway RCC cluster at UChicago, some network interfaces have an active
   intrusion detection system that drops connections that persist beyond a specific duration (~20s).
   If you get repeated ``ManagerLost`` exceptions, it would warrant taking a closer look at networking.

.. _pyversion:

parsl.dataflow.error.ConfigurationError
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Parsl configuration model underwent a major and non-backward compatible change in the transition to v0.6.0.
Prior to v0.6.0 the configuration object was a python dictionary with nested dictionaries and lists.
The switch to a class based configuration allowed for well-defined options for each specific component being
configured as well as transparency on configuration defaults. The following traceback indicates that the old
style configuration was passed to Parsl v0.6.0+ and requires an upgrade to the configuration.

.. code-block::

   File "/home/yadu/src/parsl/parsl/dataflow/dflow.py", line 70, in __init__
       'Expected `Config` class, received dictionary. For help, '
   parsl.dataflow.error.ConfigurationError: Expected `Config` class, received dictionary. For help,
   see http://parsl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubs/parsl.config.Config.html

For more information on how to update your configuration script, please refer to:
:ref:`configuration-section`.

   
Remote execution fails with SystemError(unknown opcode)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When running with Ipyparallel workers, it is important to ensure that the Python version
on the client side matches that on the side of the workers. If there's a mismatch,
the apps sent to the workers will fail with the following error:
``ipyparallel.error.RemoteError: SystemError(unknown opcode)``

.. caution::
   It is **required** that both the parsl script and all workers are set to use python
   with the same Major.Minor version numbers. For example, use Python3.5.X on both local
   and worker side.

Parsl complains about missing packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If ``parsl`` is cloned from a Github repository and added to the ``PYTHONPATH``, it is
possible to miss the installation of some dependent libraries. In this configuration,
``parsl`` will raise errors such as:

``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ipyparallel'``

In this situation, please install the required packages. If you are on a machine with
sudo privileges you could install the packages for all users, or if you choose, install
to a virtual environment using packages such as virtualenv and conda.

For instance, with conda, follow this `cheatsheet <https://conda.io/docs/_downloads/conda-cheatsheet.pdf>`_ to create a virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Activate an environmentconda install
   source activate <my_env>

   # Install packages:
   conda install <ipyparallel, dill, boto3...>


zmq.error.ZMQError: Invalid argument
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are making the transition from Parsl v0.3.0 to v0.4.0
and you run into this error, please check your config structure.
In v0.3.0, ``config['controller']['publicIp'] = '*'`` was commonly
used to specify that the IP address should be autodetected.
This has changed in v0.4.0 and setting ``'publicIp' = '*'`` results
in an error with a traceback that looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/ipyparallel/client/client.py", line 483, in __init__
   self._query_socket.connect(cfg['registration'])
   File "zmq/backend/cython/socket.pyx", line 528, in zmq.backend.cython.socket.Socket.connect (zmq/backend/cython/socket.c:5971)
   File "zmq/backend/cython/checkrc.pxd", line 25, in zmq.backend.cython.checkrc._check_rc (zmq/backend/cython/socket.c:10014)
   zmq.error.ZMQError: Invalid argument

In v0.4.0, the controller block defaults to detecting the IP address
automatically, and if that does not work for you, you can specify the
IP address explicitly like this: ``config['controller']['publicIp'] = 'IP.ADD.RES.S'``

How do I run code that uses Python2.X?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Modules or code that require Python2.X cannot be run as python apps,
however they may be run via bash apps. The primary limitation with
python apps is that all the inputs and outputs including the function
would be mangled when being transmitted between python interpreters with
different version numbers (also see :ref:`pyversion`)

Here is an example of running a python2.7 code as a bash application:

.. code-block:: python

   @bash_app
   def python_27_app (arg1, arg2 ...):
       return '''conda activate py2.7_env  # Use conda to ensure right env
       python2.7 my_python_app.py -arg {0} -d {1}
       '''.format(arg1, arg2)

Parsl hangs
^^^^^^^^^^^

There are a few common situations in which a Parsl script might hang:

1. Circular Dependency in code:
   If an ``app`` takes a list as an ``input`` argument and the future returned
   is added to that list, it creates a circular dependency that cannot be resolved.
   This situation is described in `issue 59 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/59>`_ in more detail.

2. Workers requested are unable to contact the Parsl client due to one or
   more issues listed below:

   * Parsl client does not have a public IP (e.g. laptop on wifi).
     If your network does not provide public IPs, the simple solution is to
     ssh over to a machine that is public facing. Machines provisioned from
     cloud-vendors setup with public IPs are another option.

   * Parsl hasn't autodetected the public IP. See `Workers do not connect back to Parsl`_ for more details.

   * Firewall restrictions that block certain port ranges.
     If there is a certain port range that is **not** blocked, you may specify
     that via configuration:

     .. code-block:: python

        from libsubmit.providers import Cobalt
        from parsl.config import Config
        from parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor

        config = Config(
            executors=[
                HighThroughputExecutor(
                    label='ALCF_theta_local',
                    provider=Cobalt(),
                    worer_port_range=('50000,55000'),
                    interchange_port_range=('50000,55000')
                )
            ],
        )


How can I start a Jupyter notebook over SSH?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run

.. code-block:: bash

    jupyter notebook --no-browser --ip=`/sbin/ip route get 8.8.8.8 | awk '{print $NF;exit}'`

for a Jupyter notebook, or 

.. code-block:: bash

    jupyter lab --no-browser --ip=`/sbin/ip route get 8.8.8.8 | awk '{print $NF;exit}'`

for Jupyter lab (recommended). If that doesn't work, see `these instructions <https://techtalktone.wordpress.com/2017/03/28/running-jupyter-notebooks-on-a-remote-server-via-ssh/>`_.

How can I sync my conda environment and Jupyter environment?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run::

   conda install nb_conda

Now all available conda environments (for example, one created by following the instructions `in the quickstart guide <quickstart.rst#installation-using-conda>`_) will automatically be added to the list of kernels.

.. _label_serialization_error:

Addressing SerializationError
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As of v1.0.0, Parsl will raise a `SerializationError` when it encounters an object that Parsl cannot serialize.
This applies to objects passed as arguments to an app, as well as objects returned from the app.

Parsl uses `cloudpickle <https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle>`_ and pickle to serialize Python objects
to/from functions. Therefore, Python apps can only use input and output objects that can be serialized by
cloudpickle or pickle. For example the following data types are known to have issues with serializability :

* Closures
* Objects of complex classes with no ``__dict__`` or ``__getstate__`` methods defined
* System objects such as file descriptors, sockets and locks (e.g threading.Lock)

If Parsl raises a `SerializationError`, first identify what objects are problematic with a quick test:

.. code-block:: python

   import pickle
   # If non-serializable you will get a TypeError
   pickle.dumps(YOUR_DATA_OBJECT)

If the data object simply is complex, please refer `here <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#handling-stateful-objects>`_ for more details
on adding custom mechanisms for supporting serialization.
