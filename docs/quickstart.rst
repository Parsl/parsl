Quickstart
==========

To try Parsl now (without installing any code locally), experiment with our 
`hosted tutorial notebooks on Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Parsl/parsl-tutorial/master>`_.


Installation
------------

Parsl is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/parsl/>`_ and `conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/parsl>`_. 

Parsl requires Python3.5+ and has been tested on Linux and macOS.


Installation using Pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While ``pip`` can be used to install Parsl, we suggest the following approach
for reliable installation when many Python environments are available.

1. Install Parsl::

     $ python3 -m pip install parsl

To update a previously installed parsl to a newer version, use: ``python3 -m pip install -U parsl``


Installation using Conda
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Create and activate a new conda environment::

     $ conda create --name parsl_py37 python=3.7
     $ source activate parsl_py37

2. Install Parsl::

     $ python3 -m pip install parsl

     or

     $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
     $ conda install parsl


The conda documentation provides `instructions <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/>`_ for installing conda on macOS and Linux. 

Getting started
---------------

Parsl enables concurrent execution of Python functions (`python_app`) 
or external applications (`bash_app`). Developers must first annotate
functions with Parsl decorators. When these functions are invoked, Parsl will
manage the asynchronous execution of the function on specified resources. 
The result of a call to a Parsl app is an `AppFuture`.  

The following example shows how to write a simple Parsl program
with hello world Python and Bash apps.

.. code-block:: python

    import parsl
    from parsl import python_app, bash_app

    parsl.load()

    @python_app
    def hello_python (message):
        return 'Hello %s' % message

    @bash_app
    def hello_bash(message, stdout='hello-stdout'):
        return 'echo "Hello %s"' % message

    # invoke the Python app and print the result
    print(hello_python('World (Python)').result())

    # invoke the Bash app and read the result from a file
    hello_bash('World (Bash)').result()
		
    with open('hello-stdout', 'r') as f:
        print(f.read())


Tutorial
--------

The best way to learn more about Parsl is by reviewing the Parsl tutorials.
There are several options for following the tutorial: 

1. Use `Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Parsl/parsl-tutorial/master>`_  to follow the tutorial online without installing or writing any code locally. 
2. Clone the `Parsl tutorial repository <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl-tutorial>`_ using a local Parsl installation.
3. Read through the online `tutorial documentation <1-parsl-introduction.html>`_.


Usage Tracking
--------------

To help support the Parsl project, we ask that users opt-in to anonymized usage tracking
whenever possible. Usage tracking allows us to measure usage, identify bugs, and improve
usability, reliability, and performance. Only aggregate usage statistics will be used
for reporting purposes. 

As an NSF-funded project, our ability to track usage metrics is important for continued funding. 

You can opt-in by setting ``PARSL_TRACKING=true`` in your environment or by 
setting ``usage_tracking=True`` in the configuration object (`parsl.config.Config`). 

To read more about what information is collected and how it is used see :ref:`label-usage-tracking`.


For Developers
--------------

Parsl is an open source community that encourages contributions from users
and developers. A guide for `contributing <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_ 
to Parsl is available in the `Parsl GitHub repository <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl>`_.

The following instructions outline how to set up Parsl from source.

1. Download Parsl::

    $ git clone https://github.com/Parsl/parsl

2. Install::

    $ cd parsl
    $ pip install .
    ( To install specific extra options from the source :)
    $ pip install '.[<optional_package1>...]'

3. Use Parsl!
