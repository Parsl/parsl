Parsl 1.2.0
-----------

Release date: January 13th, 2022.

Parsl v1.2.0 includes 99 pull requests with contributions from:

Ben Clifford @benclifford, Daniel S. Katz @danielskatz, Douglas Thain @dthain, James Corbett @jameshcorbett, Jonas RÃ¼benach @jrueb, Logan Ward @WardLT, Matthew R. Becker @beckermr, Vladimir @vkhodygo, Yadu Nand Babuji @yadudoc, Yo Yehudi @yochannah, Zhuozhao Li @ZhuozhaoLi, yongyanrao @yongyanrao, Tim Jenness @timj, Darko Marinov @darko-marinov, Quentin Le Boulc'h


High Throughput Executor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Remove htex self.tasks race condition that shows under high load (#2034)
* Fix htex scale down breakage due to overly aggressive result heartbeat (#2119)  [ TODO: this fixes a bug introduced since 1.1.0 so note that? #2104 ]
* Send heartbeats via results connection (#2104)


Work Queue Executor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Allow use of WorkQueue running_time_min resource constraint (#2113) - WQ recently introduced an additional resource constraint: workers can be aware of their remaining wall time, and tasks can be constrained to only go to workers with sufficient remaining time.
    
* Implement priority as a Work Queue resource specification (#2067) - The allows a workflow script to influence the order in which queued tasks are executed using Work Queue's existing priority mechanism.


* Disable WQ-level retries with an option to re-enable (#2059) - Previously by default, Work Queue will retry tasks that fail at the WQ level (for example, because of worker failure) an infinite number of times, inside the same parsl-level execution try.  That hides the repeated tries from parsl (so monitoring does not report start/end times as might naively be expected for a try, and parsl retry counting does not count).
    
* Document WorkqueueExecutor project_name remote reporting better (#2089)
* wq executor should show itself using representation mixin (#2064)
* Make WorkQueue worker command configurable (#2036)



Flux Executor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The new FluxExecutor class uses the Flux resource manager
(github: flux-framework/flux-core) to launch tasks. Each
task is a Flux job.


Condor Provider
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Fix bug in condor provider for unknown jobs (#2161)
    
LSF Provider
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Update LSF provider to make it more friendly for different LSF-based computers (#2149)

SLURM Provider
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Improve docs and defaults for slurm partition and account parameters. (#2126)

Grid Engine Provider
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* missing queue from self - causes config serialisation failure (#2042)


Monitoring
^^^^^^^^^^

* Index task_hashsum to give cross-run query speedup (#2085)
* Fix monitoring "db locked" errors occuring at scale (#1917)
* Fix worker efficiency plot when tasks are still in progress (#2048)
* Fix use of previously removed reg_time monitoring field (#2020)
* Reorder debug message so it happens when the message is received, without necessarily blocking on the resource_msgs queue put (#2093)


General new features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Workflow-pluggable retry scoring (#2068) - When a task fails, instead of causing a retry "cost" of 1 (the previous behaviour), this PR allows that cost to be determined by a user specified function which is given some context about the failure.

General bug fixes

Deprecated and Removed features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Python3.5** is now marked for deprecation, and will not be supported after this release.
  Python3.6 will be the earliest Python3 version supported in the next release.

* **App** decorator deprecated in 0.8 is now removed `issue#1539 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1539>`_
  `bash_app` and `python_app` are the only supported App decorators in this release.

* **IPyParallelExecutor** is no longer a supported executor `issue#1565 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1565>`_


New Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `parsl.executors.WorkQueueExecutor` introduced in v0.9.0 is now in beta. `parsl.executors.WorkQueueExecutor` is designed as a drop-in replacement for `parsl.executors.HighThroughputExecutor`. Here are some key features:

  * Support for packaging the python environment and shipping it to the worker side. This mechanism addresses propagating python environments in  grid-like systems that lack shared-filesystems or cloud environments.
  * `parsl.executors.WorkQueueExecutor` supports resource function tagging and resource specification
  * Support for resource specification kwarg `issue#1675 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1675>`_


* Limited type-checking in Parsl internal components (as part of an ongoing effort)


* Improvements to caching mechanism including ability to mark certain arguments to be  not counted for memoization.

  * Normalize known types for memoization, and reject unknown types (#1291). This means that previous unreliable
    behaviour for some complex types such as dicts will become more reliable; and that other previous unreliable
    behaviour for other unknown complex types will now cause an error. Handling can be added for those types using
    parsl.memoization.id_for_memo.
  * Add ability to label some arguments in an app invocation as not memoized using the ignore_for_cache app keyword (PR 1568)

* Special keyword args: 'inputs', 'outputs' that are used to specify files no longer support strings
  and now require `File` objects. For example, the following snippet is no longer supported in v1.0.0:

   .. code-block:: python

      @bash_app
      def cat(inputs=(), outputs=()):
           return 'cat {} > {}'.format(inputs[0], outputs[0])

      concat = cat(inputs=['hello-0.txt'],
                   outputs=['hello-1.txt'])

   This is the new syntax:

   .. code-block:: python

      from parsl import File

      @bash_app
      def cat(inputs=(), outputs=()):
           return 'cat {} > {}'.format(inputs[0].filepath, outputs[0].filepath)

      concat = cat(inputs=[File('hello-0.txt')],
                   outputs=[File('hello-1.txt')])

   Since filenames are no longer passed to apps as strings, and the string filepath is required, it can
   be accessed from the File object using the ``filepath`` attribute.

   .. code-block:: python

      from parsl import File

      @bash_app
      def cat(inputs=(), outputs=()):
           return 'cat {} > {}'.format(inputs[0].filepath, outputs[0].filepath)


* New launcher: `parsl.launchers.WrappedLauncher` for launching tasks inside containers.

* `parsl.channels.SSHChannel` now supports a ``key_filename`` kwarg `issue#1639 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1639>`_

* Newly added Makefile wraps several frequent developer operations such as:

  * Run the test-suite: ``make test``

  * Install parsl: ``make install``

  * Create a virtualenv: ``make virtualenv``

  * Tag release and push to release channels: ``make deploy``

* Several updates to the `parsl.executors.HighThroughputExecutor`:

  * By default, the `parsl.executors.HighThroughputExecutor` will now use heuristics to detect and try all addresses
    when the workers connect back to the parsl master. An address can be configured manually using the
    ``HighThroughputExecutor(address=<address_string>)`` kwarg option.

  * Support for Mac OS. (`pull#1469 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/pull/1469>`_, `pull#1738 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/pull/1738>`_)

  * Cleaner reporting of version mismatches and automatic suppression of non-critical errors.

  * Separate worker log directories by block id `issue#1508 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1508>`_

* Support for garbage collection to limit memory consumption in long-lived scripts.

* All cluster providers now use ``max_blocks=1`` by default `issue#1730 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1730>`_ to avoid over-provisioning.

* New ``JobStatus`` class for better monitoring of Jobs submitted to batch schedulers.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Ignore AUTO_LOGNAME for caching `issue#1642 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1642>`_
* Add batch jobs to PBS/torque job status table `issue#1650 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1650>`_
* Use higher default buffer threshold for serialization `issue#1654 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1654>`_
* Do not pass mutable default to ignore_for_cache `issue#1656 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1656>`_
* Several improvements and fixes to Monitoring
* Fix sites/test_ec2 failure when aws user opts specified `issue#1375 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1375>`_
* Fix LocalProvider to kill the right processes, rather than all processes owned by user `issue#1447 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1447>`_
* Exit htex probe loop with first working address `issue#1479 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1479>`_
* Allow slurm partition to be optional `issue#1501 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1501>`_
* Fix race condition with wait_for_tasks vs task completion `issue#1607 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1607>`_
* Fix Torque job_id truncation `issue#1583 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1583>`_
* Cleaner reporting for Serialization Errors `issue#1355 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1355>`_
* Results from zombie managers do not crash the system, but will be ignored `issue#1665 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1665>`_
* Guarantee monitoring will send out at least one message `issue#1446 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1446>`_
* Fix monitoring ctrlc hang `issue#1670 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1670>`_


Parsl 0.9.0
-----------

Released on October 25th, 2019

Parsl v0.9.0 includes 199 closed issues and pull requests with contributions (code, tests, reviews and reports) from:

Andrew Litteken @AndrewLitteken, Anna Woodard @annawoodard, Ben Clifford @benclifford,
Ben Glick @benhg, Daniel S. Katz @danielskatz, Daniel Smith @dgasmith,

@MatthewBM, Raphael Fialho @rapguit, Yadu Nand Babuji @yadudoc, and Zhuozhao Li @ZhuozhaoLi


New Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Parsl will no longer do automatic keyword substitution in ``@bash_app`` in favor of deferring to Python's `format method <https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/stdtypes.html#str.format>`_
  and newer `f-strings <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/>`_. For example,

     .. code-block:: python

        # The following example worked until v0.8.0
        @bash_app
        def cat(inputs=(), outputs=()):
            return 'cat {inputs[0]} > {outputs[0]}' # <-- Relies on Parsl auto formatting the string

        # Following are two mechanisms that will work going forward from v0.9.0
        @bash_app
        def cat(inputs=(), outputs=()):
            return 'cat {} > {}'.format(inputs[0], outputs[0]) # <-- Use str.format method

        @bash_app
        def cat(inputs=(), outputs=()):
            return f'cat {inputs[0]} > {outputs[0]}' # <-- OR use f-strings introduced in Python3.6


* ``@python_app`` now takes a ``walltime`` kwarg to limit the task execution time.
* New file staging API `parsl.data_provider.staging.Staging` to support pluggable
  file staging methods. The methods implemented in 0.8.0 (HTTP(S), FTP and
  Globus) are still present, along with two new methods which perform HTTP(S)
  and FTP staging on worker nodes to support non-shared-filesystem executors
  such as clouds.
* Behaviour change for storage_access parameter. In 0.8.0, this was used to
  specify Globus staging configuration. In 0.9.0, if this parameter is
  specified it must specify all desired staging providers. To keep the same
  staging providers as in 0.8.0, specify:

    .. code-block:: python

      from parsl.data_provider.data_manager import default_staging
      storage_access = default_staging + [GlobusStaging(...)]

  ``GlobusScheme`` in 0.8.0 has been renamed `GlobusStaging` and moved to a new
  module, parsl.data_provider.globus

* `parsl.executors.WorkQueueExecutor`: a new executor that integrates functionality from `Work Queue <http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/workqueue/>`_ is now available.
* New provider to support for Ad-Hoc clusters `parsl.providers.AdHocProvider`
* New provider added to support LSF on Summit `parsl.providers.LSFProvider`
* Support for CPU and Memory resource hints to providers `(github) <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/942>`_.
* The ``logging_level=logging.INFO`` in `parsl.monitoring.MonitoringHub` is replaced with ``monitoring_debug=False``:

   .. code-block:: python

      monitoring=MonitoringHub(
                   hub_address=address_by_hostname(),
                   hub_port=55055,
                   monitoring_debug=False,
                   resource_monitoring_interval=10,
      ),

* Managers now have a worker watchdog thread to report task failures that crash a worker.
* Maximum idletime after which idle blocks can be relinquished can now be configured as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

       config=Config(
                    max_idletime=120.0 ,  # float, unit=seconds
                    strategy='simple'
       )

* Several test-suite improvements that have dramatically reduced test duration.
* Several improvements to the Monitoring interface.
* Configurable port on `parsl.channels.SSHChannel`.
* ``suppress_failure`` now defaults to True.
* `parsl.executors.HighThroughputExecutor` is the recommended executor, and ``IPyParallelExecutor`` is deprecated.
* `parsl.executors.HighThroughputExecutor` will expose worker information via environment variables: ``PARSL_WORKER_RANK`` and ``PARSL_WORKER_COUNT``

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* ZMQError: Operation cannot be accomplished in current state bug `issue#1146 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1146>`_
* Fix event loop error with monitoring enabled `issue#532 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/532>`_
* Tasks per app graph appears as a sawtooth, not as rectangles `issue#1032 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1032>`_.
* Globus status processing failure `issue#1317 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1317>`_.
* Sporadic globus staging error `issue#1170 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1170>`_.
* RepresentationMixin breaks on classes with no default parameters `issue#1124 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1124>`_.
* File ``localpath`` staging conflict `issue#1197 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1197>`_.
* Fix IndexError when using CondorProvider with strategy enabled `issue#1298 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1298>`_.
* Improper dependency error handling causes hang `issue#1285 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1285>`_.
* Memoization/checkpointing fixes for bash apps `issue#1269 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1269>`_.
* CPU User Time plot is strangely cumulative `issue#1033 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1033>`_.
* Issue requesting resources on non-exclusive nodes `issue#1246 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1246>`_.
* parsl + htex + slurm hangs if slurm command times out, without making further progress `issue#1241 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/1241>`_.
* Fix strategy overallocations `issue#704 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/704>`_.
* max_blocks not respected in SlurmProvider `issue#868 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/868>`_.
* globus staging does not work with a non-default ``workdir`` `issue#784 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/784>`_.

Parsl 0.8.0
-----------

Released on June 13th, 2019

Parsl v0.8.0 includes 58 closed issues and pull requests with contributions (code, tests, reviews and reports)

from: Andrew Litteken @AndrewLitteken, Anna Woodard @annawoodard, Antonio Villarreal @villarrealas,
Ben Clifford @benc, Daniel S. Katz @danielskatz, Eric Tatara @etatara, Juan David Garrido @garri1105,
Kyle Chard @@kylechard, Lindsey Gray @lgray, Tim Armstrong @timarmstrong, Tom Glanzman @TomGlanzman,
Yadu Nand Babuji @yadudoc, and Zhuozhao Li @ZhuozhaoLi


New Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Monitoring is now integrated into parsl as default functionality.
* ``parsl.AUTO_LOGNAME``: Support for a special ``AUTO_LOGNAME`` option to auto generate ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` file paths.
* `File` no longer behaves as a string. This means that operations in apps that treated a `File` as  a string
  will break. For example the following snippet will have to be updated:

  .. code-block:: python

     # Old style: " ".join(inputs) is legal since inputs will behave like a list of strings
     @bash_app
     def concat(inputs=(), outputs=(), stdout="stdout.txt", stderr='stderr.txt'):
         return "cat {0} > {1}".format(" ".join(inputs), outputs[0])

     # New style:
     @bash_app
     def concat(inputs=(), outputs=(), stdout="stdout.txt", stderr='stderr.txt'):
         return "cat {0} > {1}".format(" ".join(list(map(str,inputs))), outputs[0])

* Cleaner user app file log management.
* Updated configurations using `parsl.executors.HighThroughputExecutor` in the configuration section of the userguide.
* Support for OAuth based SSH with `parsl.channels.OAuthSSHChannel`.

Parsl 0.7.2
-----------

Released on Mar 14th, 2019

New Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Monitoring: Support for reporting monitoring data to a local sqlite database is now available.
* Parsl is switching to an opt-in model for anonymous usage tracking. Read more here: :ref:`label-usage-tracking`.
* `bash_app` now supports specification of write modes for ``stdout`` and ``stderr``.
* Persistent volume support added to `parsl.providers.KubernetesProvider`.
* Scaling recommendations from study on Bluewaters is now available in the userguide.


Parsl 0.7.1
-----------

Released on Jan 18th, 2019

New Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* parsl.executors.LowLatencyExecutor: a new executor designed to address use-cases with tight latency requirements
  such as model serving (Machine Learning), function serving and interactive analyses is now available.
* New options in `parsl.executors.HighThroughputExecutor`:
     * ``suppress_failure``: Enable suppression of worker rejoin errors.
     * ``max_workers``: Limit workers spawned by manager
* Late binding of DFK, allows apps to pick DFK dynamically at call time. This functionality adds safety
  to cases where a new config is loaded and a new DFK is created.

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* A critical bug in `parsl.executors.HighThroughputExecutor` that led to debug logs overflowing channels and terminating
  blocks of resource is fixed `issue#738 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/738>`_

New functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* `parsl.executors.HighThroughputExecutor`: a new executor intended to replace the ``IPyParallelExecutor`` is now available.
  This new executor addresses several limitations of ``IPyParallelExecutor`` such as:

  * Scale beyond the ~300 worker limitation of IPP.
  * Multi-processing manager supports execution on all cores of a single node.
  * Improved worker side reporting of version, system and status info.
  * Supports failure detection and cleaner manager shutdown.

  Here's a sample configuration for using this executor locally:

   .. code-block:: python

        from parsl.providers import LocalProvider
        from parsl.channels import LocalChannel

        from parsl.config import Config
        from parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor

        config = Config(
            executors=[
                HighThroughputExecutor(
                    label="htex_local",
                    cores_per_worker=1,
                    provider=LocalProvider(
                        channel=LocalChannel(),
                        init_blocks=1,
                        max_blocks=1,
                    ),
                )
            ],
        )

   More information on configuring is available in the :ref:`configuration-section` section.

* ExtremeScaleExecutor - a new executor targeting supercomputer scale (>1000 nodes) workflows is now available.

  Here's a sample configuration for using this executor locally:

   .. code-block:: python

        from parsl.providers import LocalProvider
        from parsl.channels import LocalChannel
        from parsl.launchers import SimpleLauncher

        from parsl.config import Config
        from parsl.executors import ExtremeScaleExecutor

        config = Config(
            executors=[
                ExtremeScaleExecutor(
                    label="extreme_local",
                    ranks_per_node=4,
                    provider=LocalProvider(
                        channel=LocalChannel(),
                        init_blocks=0,
                        max_blocks=1,
                        launcher=SimpleLauncher(),
                    )
                )
            ],
            strategy=None,
        )

  More information on configuring is available in the :ref:`configuration-section` section.


* The libsubmit repository has been merged with Parsl to reduce overheads on maintenance with respect to documentation,
  testing, and release synchronization. Since the merge, the API has undergone several updates to support
  the growing collection of executors, and as a result Parsl 0.7.0+ will not be backwards compatible with
  the standalone libsubmit repos. The major components of libsubmit are now available through Parsl, and
  require the following changes to import lines to migrate scripts to 0.7.0:

    * ``from libsubmit.providers import <ProviderName>``  is now ``from parsl.providers import <ProviderName>``
    * ``from libsubmit.channels import <ChannelName>``  is now ``from parsl.channels import <ChannelName>``
    * ``from libsubmit.launchers import <LauncherName>``  is now ``from parsl.launchers import <LauncherName>``


    .. warning::
       This is a breaking change from Parsl v0.6.0

* To support resource-based requests for workers and to maintain uniformity across interfaces, ``tasks_per_node`` is
  no longer a **provider** option. Instead, the notion of ``tasks_per_node`` is defined via executor specific options,
  for eg:

    * ``IPyParallelExecutor`` provides ``workers_per_node``
    * `parsl.executors.HighThroughputExecutor` provides ``cores_per_worker`` to allow for worker launches to be determined based on
      the number of cores on the compute node.
    * ExtremeScaleExecutor uses ``ranks_per_node`` to specify the ranks to launch per node.

    .. warning::
       This is a breaking change from Parsl v0.6.0


* Major upgrades to the monitoring infrastructure.
    * Monitoring information can now be written to a SQLite database, created on the fly by Parsl
    * Web-based monitoring to track workflow progress


* Determining the correct IP address/interface given network firewall rules is often a nuisance.
  To simplify this, three new methods are now supported:

    * ``parsl.addresses.address_by_route``
    * ``parsl.addresses.address_by_query``
    * ``parsl.addresses.address_by_hostname``

* `parsl.launchers.AprunLauncher` now supports ``overrides`` option that allows arbitrary strings to be added
  to the aprun launcher call.

* `DataFlowKernel` has a new method ``wait_for_current_tasks()``

* `DataFlowKernel` now uses per-task locks and an improved mechanism to handle task completions
  improving performance for workflows with large number of tasks.

    from parsl.executors.threads import ThreadPoolExecutor

    config = Config(executors=[ThreadPoolExecutor()])

  Here's a more complex config that uses SSH to run on a Slurm based cluster

  .. code-block:: python

    from libsubmit.channels import SSHChannel
    from libsubmit.providers import SlurmProvider

    from parsl.config import Config
    from parsl.executors.ipp import IPyParallelExecutor

    config = Config(
        executors=[
            IPyParallelExecutor(
                provider=SlurmProvider(
                    'westmere',
                    channel=SSHChannel(
                        hostname='swift.rcc.uchicago.edu',
                        username=<USERNAME>,
                        script_dir=<SCRIPTDIR>
                    ),
                    init_blocks=1,
                    min_blocks=1,
                    max_blocks=2,
                    nodes_per_block=1,
                    tasks_per_node=4,
                    parallelism=0.5,
                    overrides=<SPECIFY_INSTRUCTIONS_TO_LOAD_PYTHON3>
                ),
                label='midway_ipp',
                controller=Controller(public_ip=<PUBLIC_IP>),
            )
        ]
    )

* Implicit Data Staging `issue#281 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/281>`_

  .. code-block:: python

    # create an remote Parsl file
    inp = File('ftp://www.iana.org/pub/mirror/rirstats/arin/ARIN-STATS-FORMAT-CHANGE.txt')

    # create a local Parsl file
    out = File('file:///tmp/ARIN-STATS-FORMAT-CHANGE.txt')

    # call the convert app with the Parsl file
    f = convert(inputs=[inp], outputs=[out])
    f.result()

* Support for application profiling `issue#5 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/5>`_

* Hide DFK `issue#50 <https://github.com/Parsl/parsl/issues/50>`_

  * Instead of passing a config dictionary to the DataFlowKernel, now you can call ``parsl.load(Config)``
  * Instead of having to specify the ``dfk`` at the time of ``App`` declaration, the DFK is a singleton loaded
    at call time :

    .. code-block:: python

        import parsl
        from parsl.tests.configs.local_ipp import config
        parsl.load(config)

        @App('python')
        def double(x):
            return x * 2

    app_fu, [file1, file2] = make_files(x, y, outputs=['f1.txt', 'f2.txt'])

    #This is the style that will be followed going forward.
    app_fu = make_files(x, y, outputs=['f1.txt', 'f2.txt'])
    [file1, file2] = app_fu.outputs
