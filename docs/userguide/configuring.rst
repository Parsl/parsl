Configuration
=============

Parsl separates program logic from execution configuration, enabling
programs to be developed entirely independently from their execution
environment. Configuration is described by a Python object (:class:`~parsl.config.Config`) 
so that developers can 
introspect permissible options, validate settings, and retrieve/edit
configurations dynamically during execution. A configuration object specifies 
details of the provider, executors, connection channel, allocation size, 
queues, durations, and data management options. 

The following example shows a basic configuration object (:class:`~parsl.config.Config`) for the Frontera
supercomputer at TACC.
This config uses the `parsl.executors.HighThroughputExecutor` to submit
tasks from a login node (`parsl.channels.LocalChannel`). It requests an allocation of
128 nodes, deploying 1 worker for each of the 56 cores per node, from the normal partition.
The config uses the `address_by_hostname()` helper function to determine
the login node's IP address.

.. code-block:: python

    from parsl.config import Config
    from parsl.channels import LocalChannel
    from parsl.providers import SlurmProvider
    from parsl.executors import HighThroughputExecutor
    from parsl.launchers import SrunLauncher
    from parsl.addresses import address_by_hostname

    config = Config(
        executors=[
            HighThroughputExecutor(
                label="frontera_htex",
                address=address_by_hostname(),
                max_workers=56,
                provider=SlurmProvider(
                    channel=LocalChannel(),
                    nodes_per_block=128,
                    init_blocks=1,
                    partition='normal',                                 
                    launcher=SrunLauncher(),
                ),
            )
        ],
    )

   All configuration examples below must be customized for the user's 
   allocation, Python environment, file system, etc.

How to Configure
----------------

The configuration specifies what, and how, resources are to be used for executing
the Parsl program and its apps.
It is important to carefully consider the needs of the Parsl program and its apps,
and the characteristics of the compute resources, to determine an ideal configuration. 
Aspects to consider include:
1) where the Parsl apps will execute;
2) how many nodes will be used to execute the apps, and how long the apps will run;
3) should Parsl request multiple nodes in an individual scheduler job; and
4) where will the main Parsl program run and how will it communicate with the apps.

Stepping through the following question should help formulate a suitable configuration object.

1. Where should apps be executed?

2.  How many nodes will be used to execute the apps? What task durations are necessary to achieve good performance?


+------------------------------------------+----------------------+-------------------------------------+

.. [*] Assuming 32 workers per node. If there are fewer workers launched
       per node, a larger number of nodes could be supported.

.. [*] 8,000 nodes with 32 workers (256,000 workers) is the maximum scale at which
       the `parsl.executors.ExtremeScaleExecutor` has been tested.

.. [*] The maximum number of nodes tested for the `parsl.executors.WorkQueueExecutor` is 10,000 GPU cores and
       20,000 CPU cores.

.. warning:: ``IPyParallelExecutor`` is  deprecated as of Parsl v0.8.0. `parsl.executors.HighThroughputExecutor`
   is the recommended replacement.


3. Should Parsl request multiple nodes in an individual scheduler job? 
(Here the term block is equivalent to a single scheduler job.)

+-------------------------------------+--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+

.. note:: If using a Cray system, you most likely need to use the `parsl.launchers.AprunLauncher` to launch workers unless you
          are on a **native Slurm** system like :ref:`configuring_nersc_cori`


4) Where will the main Parsl program run and how will it communicate with the apps?

+------------------------+--------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+

| Laptop/Workstation     | Cloud Resources          | No channel is needed                              |
+------------------------+--------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+

+------------------------+--------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| Login node             | Cluster/Supercomputer    | `parsl.channels.LocalChannel`                     |
+------------------------+--------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+

Heterogeneous Resources
-----------------------

In some cases, it can be difficult to specify the resource requirements for running a workflow.
For example, if the compute nodes a site provides are not uniform, there is no "correct" resource configuration;
the amount of parallelism depends on which node (large or small) each job runs on.
In addition, the software and filesystem setup can vary from node to node.
A Condor cluster may not provide shared filesystem access at all,
and may include nodes with a variety of Python versions and available libraries.

The `parsl.executors.WorkQueueExecutor` provides several features to work with heterogeneous resources.
By default, Parsl only runs one app at a time on each worker node.
However, it is possible to specify the requirements for a particular app,
and Work Queue will automatically run as many parallel instances as possible on each node.
Work Queue automatically detects the amount of cores, memory, and other resources available on each execution node.
To activate this feature, add a resource specification to your apps. A resource specification is a dictionary with
the following three keys: ``cores`` (an integer corresponding to the number of cores required by the task),
``memory`` (an integer corresponding to the task's memory requirement in MB), and ``disk`` (an integer corresponding to
the task's disk requirement in MB), passed to an app via the special keyword argument ``parsl_resource_specification``. The specification can be set for all app invocations via a default, for example:

   .. code-block:: python

      @python_app
      def compute(x, parsl_resource_specification={'cores': 1, 'memory': 1000, 'disk': 1000}):
          return x*2


or updated when the app is invoked:

   .. code-block:: python

      spec = {'cores': 1, 'memory': 500, 'disk': 500}
      future = compute(x, parsl_resource_specification=spec)

This ``parsl_resource_specification`` special keyword argument will inform Work Queue about the resources this app requires.
When placing instances of ``compute(x)``, Work Queue will run as many parallel instances as possible based on each worker node's available resources.

If an app's resource requirements are not known in advance,
Work Queue has an auto-labeling feature that measures the actual resource usage of your apps and automatically chooses resource labels for you.
With auto-labeling, it is not necessary to provide ``parsl_resource_specification``;
Work Queue collects stats in the background and updates resource labels as your workflow runs.
To activate this feature, add the following flags to your executor config:

   .. code-block:: python

      config = Config(
          executors=[
              WorkQueueExecutor(
                  # ...other options go here
                  autolabel=True,
                  autocategory=True
              )
          ]
      )

The ``autolabel`` flag tells Work Queue to automatically generate resource labels.
By default, these labels are shared across all apps in your workflow.
The ``autocategory`` flag puts each app into a different category,
so that Work Queue will choose separate resource requirements for each app.
This is important if e.g. some of your apps use a single core and some apps require multiple cores.
Unless you know that all apps have uniform resource requirements,
you should turn on ``autocategory`` when using ``autolabel``.

The Work Queue executor can also help deal with sites that have non-uniform software environments across nodes.
Parsl assumes that the Parsl program and the compute nodes all use the same Python version.
In addition, any packages your apps import must be available on compute nodes.
If no shared filesystem is available or if node configuration varies,
this can lead to difficult-to-trace execution problems.

If your Parsl program is running in a Conda environment,
the Work Queue executor can automatically scan the imports in your apps,
create a self-contained software package,
transfer the software package to worker nodes,
and run your code inside the packaged and uniform environment.
First, make sure that the Conda environment is active and you have the required packages installed (via either ``pip`` or ``conda``):

- ``python``
- ``parsl``
- ``ndcctools``
- ``conda-pack``

Then add the following to your config:

   .. code-block:: python

      config = Config(
          executors=[
              WorkQueueExecutor(
                  # ...other options go here
                  pack=True
              )
          ]
      )

.. note::
   There will be a noticeable delay the first time Work Queue sees an app;
   it is creating and packaging a complete Python environment.
   This packaged environment is cached, so subsequent app invocations should be much faster.

Using this approach, it is possible to run Parsl applications on nodes that don't have Python available at all.
The packaged environment includes a Python interpreter,
and Work Queue does not require Python to run.

.. note::
   The automatic packaging feature only supports packages installed via ``pip`` or ``conda``.
   Importing from other locations (e.g. via ``$PYTHONPATH``) or importing other modules in the same directory is not supported.

Ad-Hoc Clusters
---------------

Any collection of compute nodes without a scheduler can be considered an
ad-hoc cluster. Often these machines have a shared file system such as NFS or Lustre.
In order to use these resources with Parsl, they need to set-up for password-less SSH access.

To use these ssh-accessible collection of nodes as an ad-hoc cluster, we use
the `parsl.providers.AdHocProvider` with an `parsl.channels.SSHChannel` to each node. An example
configuration follows.

.. literalinclude:: ../../parsl/configs/ad_hoc.py

.. note::
   Multiple blocks should not be assigned to each node when using the `parsl.executors.HighThroughputExecutor`

Amazon Web Services
-------------------

.. image:: ./aws_image.png

.. note::
   To use AWS with Parsl, install Parsl with AWS dependencies via ``python3 -m pip install 'parsl[aws]'``

Amazon Web Services is a commercial cloud service which allows users to rent a range of computers and other computing services.
The following snippet shows how Parsl can be configured to provision nodes from the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service.
The first time this configuration is used, Parsl will configure a Virtual Private Cloud and other networking and security infrastructure that will be
re-used in subsequent executions. The configuration uses the `parsl.providers.AWSProvider` to connect to AWS.

CCL (Notre Dame, with Work Queue)
---------------------------------

.. image:: http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/workqueue/WorkQueueLogoSmall.png

To utilize Work Queue with Parsl, please install the full CCTools software package within an appropriate Anaconda or Miniconda environment
(instructions for installing Miniconda can be found `in the Conda install guide <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/>`_):

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda create -y --name <environment> python=<version> conda-pack
   $ conda activate <environment>
   $ conda install -y -c conda-forge ndcctools parsl

This creates a Conda environment on your machine with all the necessary tools and setup needed to utilize Work Queue with the Parsl library.

The following snippet shows an example configuration for using the Work Queue distributed framework to run applications on remote machines at large.
This examples uses the `parsl.executors.WorkQueueExecutor` to schedule tasks locally,
and assumes that Work Queue workers have been externally connected to the master using the
`work_queue_factory <https://cctools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man_pages/work_queue_factory/>`_ or
`condor_submit_workers <https://cctools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man_pages/condor_submit_workers/>`_ command line utilities from CCTools.

Kubernetes is an open-source system for container management, such as automating deployment and scaling of containers.
The snippet below shows an example configuration for deploying pods as workers on a Kubernetes cluster.
The KubernetesProvider exploits the Python Kubernetes API, which assumes that you have kube config in ``~/.kube/config``.

This Midway cluster is a campus cluster hosted by the Research Computing Center at the University of Chicago.
The snippet below shows an example configuration for executing remotely on Midway.
The configuration assumes the user is running on a login node and uses the `parsl.providers.SlurmProvider` to interface
with the scheduler, and uses the `parsl.launchers.SrunLauncher` to launch workers.
