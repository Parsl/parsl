Execution
=========

Contemporary computing environments may include a wide range of computational platforms or **execution providers**, from laptops and PCs to various clusters, supercomputers, and cloud computing platforms. Different execution providers may require or allow for the use of different **execution models**, such as threads (for efficient parallel execution on a multicore processor), processes, and pilot jobs for running many small tasks on a large parallel system. 

Parsl is designed to abstract these low-level details so that an identical Parsl program can run unchanged on different platforms or across multiple platforms. 
To this end, Parsl uses a configuration file to specify which execution provider(s) and execution model(s) to use.
Parsl provides a high level abstraction, called a *block*, for providing a uniform description of a compute resource irrespective of the specific execution provider.

.. note::
   Refer to :ref:`configuration-section` for information on how to configure the various components described
   below for specific scenarios.

Execution providers
-------------------

Clouds, supercomputers, and local PCs offer vastly different modes of access. 
To overcome these differences, and present a single uniform interface, 
Parsl implements a simple provider abstraction. This
abstraction is key to Parsl's ability to enable scripts to be moved
between resources. The provider interface exposes three core actions: submit a
job for execution (e.g., sbatch for the Slurm resource manager), 
retrieve the status of an allocation (e.g., squeue), and cancel a running
job (e.g., scancel). Parsl implements providers for local execution
(fork), for various cloud platforms using cloud-specific APIs, and
for clusters and supercomputers that use a Local Resource Manager
(LRM) to manage access to resources, such as Slurm and HTCondor.

Each provider implementation may allow users to specify additional parameters for further configuration. Parameters are generally mapped to LRM submission script or cloud API options.
Examples of LRM-specific options are partition, wall clock time,
scheduler options (e.g., #SBATCH arguments for Slurm), and worker
initialization commands (e.g., loading a conda environment). Cloud
parameters include access keys, instance type, and spot bid price

Parsl currently supports the following providers:

1. `parsl.providers.LocalProvider`: The provider allows you to run locally on your laptop or workstation.
2. `parsl.providers.SlurmProvider`: This provider allows you to schedule resources via the Slurm scheduler.
3. `parsl.providers.CondorProvider`: This provider allows you to schedule resources via the Condor scheduler.
4. `parsl.providers.GridEngineProvider`: This provider allows you to schedule resources via the GridEngine scheduler.
5. `parsl.providers.TorqueProvider`: This provider allows you to schedule resources via the Torque scheduler.
6. `parsl.providers.AWSProvider`: This provider allows you to provision and manage cloud nodes from Amazon Web Services.
7. `parsl.providers.GoogleCloudProvider`: This provider allows you to provision and manage cloud nodes from Google Cloud.
8. `parsl.providers.KubernetesProvider`: This provider allows you to provision and manage containers on a Kubernetes cluster.
9. `parsl.providers.LSFProvider`: This provider allows you to schedule resources via IBM's LSF scheduler.



Executors
---------

Parsl programs vary widely in terms of their
execution requirements. Individual Apps may run for milliseconds
or days, and available parallelism can vary between none for 
sequential programs to millions for "pleasingly parallel" programs.
Parsl executors, as the name suggests, execute Apps on one or more
target execution resources such as multi-core workstations, clouds,
or supercomputers. As it appears infeasible to implement a single
execution strategy that will meet so many diverse requirements on
such varied platforms, Parsl provides a modular executor interface
and a collection of executors that are tuned for common execution
patterns. 

Parsl executors extend the Executor class offered by Python's
concurrent.futures library, which allows Parsl to use 
existing solutions in the Python Standard Library (e.g., ThreadPoolExecutor)
and from other packages such as Work Queue. Parsl
extends the concurrent.futures executor interface to support 
additional capabilities such as automatic scaling of execution resources,
monitoring, deferred initialization, and methods to set working
directories.
All executors share a common execution kernel that is responsible 
for deserializing the task (i.e., the App and its input arguments)
and executing the task in a sandboxed Python environment.

Parsl currently supports the following executors:

1. `parsl.executors.ThreadPoolExecutor`: This executor supports multi-thread execution on local resources.

2. `parsl.executors.HighThroughputExecutor`: This executor implements hierarchical scheduling and batching using a pilot job model to deliver high throughput task execution on up to 4000 Nodes.

3. `parsl.executors.WorkQueueExecutor`: This executor integrates `Work Queue <http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/workqueue/>`_ as an execution backend. Work Queue scales to tens of thousands of cores and implements reliable execution of tasks with dynamic resource sizing.

4. `parsl.executors.taskvine.TaskVineExecutor`: This executor uses `TaskVine <https://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/taskvine/>`_ as the execution backend. TaskVine scales up to tens of thousands of cores and actively uses local storage on compute nodes to offer a diverse array of performance-oriented features, including: smart caching and sharing common large files between tasks and compute nodes, reliable execution of tasks, dynamic resource sizing, automatic Python environment detection and sharing.
These executors cover a broad range of execution requirements. As with other Parsl components, there is a standard interface (ParslExecutor) that can be implemented to add support for other executors.

5. `parsl.executors.GlobusComputeExecutor`: This executor uses `Globus Compute <https://www.globus.org/compute>`_
as the execution backend. Globus Compute is a distributed Function as a Service (FaaS) platform that enables secure
execution of functions on heterogeneous remote computers, from laptops to campus clusters, clouds, and supercomputers.
Functions are executed on `Globus Compute Endpoints <https://globus-compute.readthedocs.io/en/latest/endpoints/endpoints.html>`_
that can be `configured <https://globus-compute.readthedocs.io/en/latest/endpoints/endpoint_examples.html>`_
to scale execution on most batch schedulers automatically. Since Globus Compute Endpoints use `parsl.executors.HighThroughputExecutor`
as the default execution system, this executor can be thought of as an extension of the `parsl.executors.HighThroughputExecutor` with
a secure and reliable remote execution wrapper.

.. note::
   Refer to :ref:`configuration-section` for information on how to configure these executors.


---------

Many LRMs offer mechanisms for spawning applications across nodes 
inside a single job and for specifying the
resources and task placement information needed to execute that
application at launch time. Common mechanisms include
`srun <https://slurm.schedmd.com/srun.html>`_ (for Slurm), 
`aprun <https://cug.org/5-publications/proceedings_attendee_lists/2006CD/S06_Proceedings/pages/Authors/Karo-4C/Karo_alps_paper.pdf>`_ (for Crays), and `mpirun <https://www.open-mpi.org/doc/v2.0/man1/mpirun.1.php>`_ (for MPI). 
Thus, to run Parsl programs on such systems, we typically want first to 
request a large number of nodes and then to *launch* "pilot job" or 
**worker** processes using the system launchers. 
Parsl's Launcher abstraction enables Parsl programs
to use these system-specific launcher systems to start workers across 
cores and nodes.

Parsl currently supports the following set of launchers:

1. `parsl.launchers.SrunLauncher`: Srun based launcher for Slurm based systems.
2. `parsl.launchers.AprunLauncher`: Aprun based launcher for Crays.
3. `parsl.launchers.SrunMPILauncher`: Launcher for launching MPI applications with Srun.
4. `parsl.launchers.GnuParallelLauncher`: Launcher using GNU parallel to launch workers across nodes and cores.
5. `parsl.launchers.MpiExecLauncher`: Uses Mpiexec to launch.
6. `parsl.launchers.SimpleLauncher`: The launcher default to a single worker launch.
7. `parsl.launchers.SingleNodeLauncher`: This launcher launches ``workers_per_node`` count workers on a single node.

Additionally, the launcher interface can be used to implement specialized behaviors
in custom environments (for example, to
launch node processes inside containers with customized environments). 
For example, the following launcher uses Srun to launch ``worker-wrapper``, passing the
command to be run as parameters to ``worker-wrapper``. It is the responsibility of ``worker-wrapper``
to launch the command it is given inside the appropriate environment.

.. code:: python

   class MyShifterSRunLauncher:
       def __init__(self):
           self.srun_launcher = SrunLauncher()

       def __call__(self, command, tasks_per_node, nodes_per_block):
           new_command="worker-wrapper {}".format(command)
           return self.srun_launcher(new_command, tasks_per_node, nodes_per_block)

Blocks
------

One challenge when making use of heterogeneous 
execution resource types is the need to provide a uniform representation of
resources. Consider that single requests on clouds return individual
nodes, clusters and supercomputers provide batches of nodes, grids
provide cores, and workstations provide a single multicore node

Parsl defines a resource abstraction called a *block* as the most basic unit
of resources to be acquired from a provider. A block contains one
or more nodes and maps to the different provider abstractions. In
a cluster, a block corresponds to a single allocation request to a
scheduler. In a cloud, a block corresponds to a single API request
for one or more instances. 
Parsl can then execute *tasks* (instances of apps)
within and across (e.g., for MPI jobs) nodes within a block.
Blocks are also used as the basis for
elasticity on batch scheduling systems (see Elasticity below).
Three different examples of block configurations are shown below.

1. A single block comprised of a node executing one task:

   .. image:: ../../images/N1_T1.png
      :scale: 75%

2. A single block with one node executing several tasks. This configuration is
   most suitable for single threaded apps running on multicore target systems.
   The number of tasks executed concurrently is proportional to the number of cores available on the system.

   .. image:: ../../images/N1_T4.png
       :scale: 75%

3. A block comprised of several nodes and executing several tasks, where a task can span multiple nodes. This configuration
   is generally used by MPI applications. Starting a task requires using a specific
   MPI launcher that is supported on the target system (e.g., aprun, srun, mpirun, mpiexec).
   The `MPI Apps <mpi_apps.html>`_ documentation page describes how to configure Parsl for this case.

   .. image:: ../../images/N4_T2.png

The configuration options for specifying the shape of each block are:

1. ``workers_per_node``: Number of workers started per node, which corresponds to the number of tasks that can execute concurrently on a node.
2. ``nodes_per_block``: Number of nodes requested per block.



Multi-executor
--------------

Parsl supports the use of one or more executors as specified in the configuration. 
In this situation, individual apps may indicate which executors they are able to use. 

The common scenarios for this feature are:

* A workflow has an initial simulation stage that runs on the compute heavy
  nodes of an HPC system followed by an analysis and visualization stage that
  is better suited for GPU nodes.
* A workflow follows a repeated fan-out, fan-in model where the long running
  fan-out tasks are computed on a cluster and the quick fan-in computation is
  better suited for execution using threads on a login node.
* A workflow includes apps that wait and evaluate the results of a
  computation to determine whether the app should be relaunched.
  Only apps running on threads may launch other apps. Often, simulations
  have stochastic behavior and may terminate before completion.
  In such cases, having a wrapper app that checks the exit code
  and determines whether or not the app has completed successfully can
  be used to automatically re-execute the app (possibly from a
  checkpoint) until successful completion.


The following code snippet shows how apps can specify suitable executors in the app decorator.

.. code-block:: python

     #(CPU heavy app) (CPU heavy app) (CPU heavy app) <--- Run on compute queue
     #      |                |               |
     #    (data)           (data)          (data)
     #       \               |              /
     #       (Analysis and visualization phase)         <--- Run on GPU node

     # A mock molecular dynamics simulation app
     @bash_app(executors=["Theta.Phi"])
     def MD_Sim(arg, outputs=()):
         return "MD_simulate {} -o {}".format(arg, outputs[0])

     # Visualize results from the mock MD simulation app
     @bash_app(executors=["Cooley.GPU"])
     def visualize(inputs=(), outputs=()):
         bash_array = " ".join(inputs)
         return "viz {} -o {}".format(bash_array, outputs[0])
