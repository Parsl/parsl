Execution Providers
===================

Parsl presents a uniform interface to managing compute resources
from a single computer with a single user up to
supercomputers managed through batch schedulers.
Each provider exposes three core actions: submit a
job for execution (e.g., sbatch for the Slurm resource manager),
retrieve the status of an allocation (e.g., squeue),
and cancel a running job (e.g., scancel).

All Providers manage resources in terms of **blocks**.
Blocks are collections of one or more **nodes** that each
run at least one worker. [#mpi]_
Control the size of a block with the ``nodes_per_block`` option
and the number of blocks with `elasticity settings <elasticity.html>`_.

Start by selecting a scheduler from following classes,
then configuring the details required.

Local Provider
--------------

The :class:`~parsl.providers.LocalProvider` starts workers on the same
computer running the Parsl main script.
It is primarily used when testing Parsl programs
before deploying them to distributed resources.

Cluster Schedulers
------------------

Schedulers are used at facilities where a single compute clusters shared by many teams.
Users request individual "batch jobs" that will be ran once resources are available.
Parsl will create and manage its own batch jobs.

Configuring a cluster scheduler requires:

1. Account information (e.g., where to charge hours)
2. The size of each Job (e.g., node count, duration)

Available options include:

1. :class:`~parsl.providers.SlurmProvider`
2. :class:`~parsl.providers.CondorProvider`
3. :class:`~parsl.providers.GridEngineProvider`
4. :class:`~parsl.providers.TorqueProvider`
5. :class:`~parsl.providers.PBSProvider`
6. :class:`~parsl.providers.LSFProvider`

Kubernetes
----------

**Provider**: :class:`~parsl.providers.KubernetesProvider`

Kubernetes manages many small services running together on a single set of compute nodes.
Users define services then request Kubernetes to start or stop copies as appropriate.
Kubernetes creates each service inside an isolated "container,"
decides where each copy runs, and manages connecting them to networks or storage.
Parsl can use Kubernetes to launch workers as services.

Configure :class:`~parsl.providers.KubernetesProvider` by providing:

1. Authentication details (e.g., user name, secrets)
2. The type of each container (e.g., base image, RAM, CPU)
3. Disk availability (e.g., which volumes containers can access)
