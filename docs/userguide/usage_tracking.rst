Usage statistics collection
===========================

Parsl uses an **Opt-in** model to send usage statistics back to the Parsl development team to
measure worldwide usage and improve reliability and usability. The usage statistics are used only for
improvements and reporting. They are not shared in raw form outside of the Parsl team.


Why are we doing this?
----------------------

The Parsl development team receives support from government funding agencies. For the team to continue to
receive such funding, and for the agencies themselves to argue for funding, both the team and the agencies
must be able to demonstrate that the scientific community is benefiting from these investments. To this end,
it is important that we provide aggregate usage data about such things as the following:

* How many people use Parsl
* Average job length
* Parsl exit codes

By participating in this project, you help justify continuing support for the software on which you rely.
(see :ref:`What is sent? <what-is-sent>` below).

Opt-In
------

We have chosen opt-in collection rather than opt-out with the hope that developers and researchers
will choose to send us this information. The reason is that we need this data - it is a requirement for funding.

By opting-in, and allowing these statistics to be reported back, you are explicitly supporting the
further development of Parsl.

If you wish to opt in to usage reporting, set ``PARSL_TRACKING=true`` in your environment or set ``usage_tracking=True`` in the configuration object (`parsl.config.Config`).


.. _what-is-sent:

What is sent?
-------------

* IP address
* Run UUID
* Start and end times
* Number of executors used
* Number of failures
* Parsl and Python version
* OS and OS version


How is the data sent?
---------------------

The data is sent via UDP. While this may cause us to lose some data, it drastically reduces the possibility
that the usage statistics reporting will adversely affect the operation of the software.


When is the data sent?
----------------------

The data is sent twice per run, once when Parsl starts a script, and once when the script is completed.


What will the data be used for?
-------------------------------

The data will be used for reporting purposes to answer questions such as:

* How many unique users are using Parsl?
* To determine patterns of usage - is activity increasing or decreasing?

We will also use this information to improve Parsl by identifying software faults.

* What percentage of tasks complete successfully?
* Of the tasks that fail, what is the most common fault code returned?

Feedback
--------

Please send us your feedback at parsl@googlegroups.com. Feedback from our user communities will be
useful in determining our path forward with usage tracking in the future.
