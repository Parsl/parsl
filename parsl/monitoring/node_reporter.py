"""This script is for sending a node report to monitoring at the start of a
batch job, immediately before launching a worker process.

This is not needed for the HighThroughputExecutor, which contains node
reporting code internally.

This expects to receive parameters that align with the parsl work queue worker
such as the block ID.
