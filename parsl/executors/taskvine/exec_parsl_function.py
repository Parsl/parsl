# This scripts executes a parsl function which is pickled in 4 files:
#
# exec_parsl_function.py map_file function_file argument_file result_file
#
# map_file: Contains a pickled dictionary that indicates which local_paths the
#           parsl Files should take.
#
# function_file: Contains a pickle parsl function. Function might be serialized in advance.
# See @parsl.serialize.concretes.py
#
# argument_file: Contains the serialized arguments to the function call.
#
# result_file: A file path, whose content will contain the result of the function, including any
#              exception generated. Exceptions will be wrapped with RemoteExceptionWrapper.
#
# Exit codes:
# 0: The function was evaluated to completion. The result or any exception
#    wrapped with RemoteExceptionWrapper were written to result_file.
# anything else: There was an error that prevented writing to the result file altogether.
#                The exit code corresponds to whatever the python interpreter gives.
