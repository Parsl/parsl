class ParslExecutor(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """Executors are abstractions that represent available compute resources
    to which you could submit arbitrary App tasks.

    This is a metaclass that only enforces concrete implementations of
    functionality by the child classes.

    Can be used as a context manager. On exit, calls ``self.shutdown()`` with
    no arguments and re-raises any thrown exception.

    In addition to the listed methods, a ParslExecutor instance must always
    have a member field:

       label: str - a human readable label for the executor, unique
              with respect to other executors.

    Per-executor monitoring behaviour can be influenced by exposing:

       radio_mode: str - a string describing which radio mode should be used to
              send task resource data back to the submit side.

    An executor may optionally expose:

       storage_access: List[parsl.data_provider.staging.Staging] - a list of staging
              providers that will be used for file staging. In the absence of this
              attribute, or if this attribute is `None`, then a default value of
              ``parsl.data_provider.staging.default_staging`` will be used by the
              staging code.

              Typechecker note: Ideally storage_access would be declared on executor
              __init__ methods as List[Staging] - however, lists are by default
              invariant, not co-variant, and it looks like @typeguard cannot be
              persuaded otherwise. So if you're implementing an executor and want to
              @typeguard the constructor, you'll have to use List[Any] here.

        abnormal conditions. This can be done externally, as well as internally, through
