    Specification of Parsl configuration options.

    Parameters
    ----------
    executors : list of ParslExecutor, optional
        List of `ParslExecutor` instances to use for executing tasks.
        Default is [:class:`~parsl.executors.threads.ThreadPoolExecutor()`].
    app_cache : bool, optional
        Enable app caching. Default is True.
    checkpoint_files : sequence of str, optional
        List of paths to checkpoint files. See :func:`parsl.utils.get_all_checkpoints` and
        :func:`parsl.utils.get_last_checkpoint` for helpers. Default is None.
    checkpoint_mode : str, optional
        Checkpoint mode to use, can be ``'dfk_exit'``, ``'task_exit'``, ``'periodic'`` or ``'manual'``.
        If set to `None`, checkpointing will be disabled. Default is None.
    checkpoint_period : str, optional
        Time interval (in "HH:MM:SS") at which to checkpoint completed tasks. Only has an effect if
        ``checkpoint_mode='periodic'``.
    garbage_collect : bool. optional.
        Delete task records from DFK when tasks have completed. Default: True
    internal_tasks_max_threads : int, optional
        Maximum number of threads to allocate for submit side internal tasks such as some data transfers
        or @joinapps
        Default is 10.
    monitoring : MonitoringHub, optional
        The config to use for database monitoring. Default is None which does not log to a database.
    retries : int, optional
        Set the number of retries (or available retry budget when using retry_handler) in case of failure. Default is 0.
    retry_handler : function, optional
        A user pluggable handler to decide if/how a task retry should happen.
        If no handler is specified, then each task failure incurs a retry cost
        of 1.
    run_dir : str, optional
        Path to run directory. Default is 'runinfo'.
    strategy : str, optional
        Strategy to use for scaling blocks according to workflow needs. Can be 'simple', 'htex_auto_scale' or `None`.
        If `None`, dynamic scaling will be disabled. Default is 'simple'.
    max_idletime : float, optional
        The maximum idle time allowed for an executor before strategy could shut down unused blocks. Default is 120.0 seconds.
    usage_tracking : bool, optional
        Set this field to True to opt-in to Parsl's usage tracking system. Parsl only collects minimal, non personally-identifiable,
        information used for reporting to our funding agencies. Default is False.
    initialize_logging : bool, optional
        Make DFK optionally not initialize any logging. Log messages
        will still be passed into the python logging system under the
        ``parsl`` logger name, but the logging system will not by default
        perform any further log system configuration. Most noticeably,
        it will not create a parsl.log logfile.  The use case for this
        is when parsl is used as a library in a bigger system which
        wants to configure logging in a way that makes sense for that
        bigger system as a whole.
