# if we want to remove on preemption, this might work:
#    PERIODIC_REMOVE = (NumJobstarts > 1)
# or if the pilot can trap signals, then we can send a special exit code on
# sigterm/sigkill and remove that way. but then we still need to be careful in
# cases where the worker dies, for example-- no signal is sent
