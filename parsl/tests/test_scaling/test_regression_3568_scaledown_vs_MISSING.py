    # The above config means that we should start scaling out one initial
    # block, but then scale it back in after a second or so if the executor
    # is kept idle (which this test does using try_assert).

    # Because of 'sleep inf' in the WrappedLaucher, the block will not ever
    # register.

    # The bug being tested is about mistreatment of blocks which are scaled in
    # before they have a chance to register, and the above forces that to
    # happen.

    # After that scaling in has happened, we should see that we have one block
    # and it should be in a terminal state. The below try_assert waits for
    # that to become true.

    # At that time, we should also see htex reporting no blocks registered - as
    # mentioned above, that is a necessary part of the bug being tested here.

    # Give 10 strategy periods for the above to happen: each step of scale up,
    # and scale down due to idleness isn't guaranteed to happen in exactly one
    # scaling step.

    # Now we can reconfigure the launcher to let subsequent blocks launch ok,
    # and run a trivial task. That trivial task will scale up a new block and
    # run the task successfully.

    # Prior to issue #3568, the bug was that the scale in of the first
    # block earlier in the test case would have incorrectly been treated as a
    # failure, and then the block error handler would have treated that failure
    # as a permanent htex failure, and so the task execution below would raise
    # a BadStateException rather than attempt to run the task.
