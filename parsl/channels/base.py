    """Channels are abstractions that enable ExecutionProviders to talk to
    resource managers of remote compute facilities.

    For certain resources such as campus clusters or supercomputers at
    research laboratories, resource requirements may require authentication.

    The only remaining Channel, *LocalChannel*, executes commands locally in a
    shell.

    Channels provide the ability to execute commands remotely, using the
    execute_wait method, and manipulate the remote file system using methods
    such as push_file, pull_file and makedirs.

    Channels should ensure that each launched command runs in a new process
    group, so that providers (such as LocalProvider) which terminate long
    running commands using process groups can do so.
